# dr-quine

This project serves as an introduction to quines - self-replicating programs implemented in C/Assembly/Python. The project is split into three parts, each with additional requirements beyond its main goal.

### Colleen

This is a simple quine. When executed, it displays its source code on the standard output.

### Grace

When executed, it writes its source code to a file named `Grace_kid.*`.

### Sully

When executed, it writes its source code to a file named `Sully_X.*`, where `X` is decremented at each execution. It then compiles and executes the new file, repeating the process.
